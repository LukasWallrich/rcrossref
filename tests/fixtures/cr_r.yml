        we face a considerable improvement in education technologies, yet children\u2019s
        spelling assessment is still a paper-and- pencil based method. Since it is
        a regular activity in literacy class- rooms and has to be conducted individually
        with each child, it is a laborious task for a teacher. It is challenging to
        offer an optimal number of tests because of the number of students in a single
        class. Moreover, the pandemic period highlighted the need for digital resources
        to support this activity remotely. In this context, we are developing a method
        for conducting automated word dictation sessions and support teachers in identifying
        children spelling development stages. Using DSRM, we believe that we can provide
        not only offering a more playful writing experience for children through technology,

        Electronic health records have changed providers\u2019 workflow. Epic\u2019s
        InBasket supplants traditional communication and is a central hub for clinical
        information. Failure to promptly complete records impairs communication and
        revenue collection. By tracking providers\u2019 InBasket activities and offering
        feedback, we hoped to improve InBasket management and interdisciplinary communication.
        <\/jats:p><\/jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Methods:<\/jats:title><jats:p>
        We created a report to track 273 providers\u2019 InBasket activities, including
        ambulatory transcriptions, chart cosignatures, order cosignatures, patient
        calls, results, and billable encounters. The report showed how often and for
        how long each activity was delinquent. We completed three Plan-Do-Study-Act
        cycles. During cycle 1 (November to December 2015), we sent all providers
        automated e-mails with their monthly results. During cycle 2 (January to April
        2016), we focused solely on billable encounter closure and sent targeted e-mails
        to providers with &gt; 50 delinquent encounters. The e-mails stated that providers
        had 30 days to complete encounters or their practices would be closed to new
        patients; at 30 days, noncompliant providers had 60 days before practice suspension.
        During cycle 3 (May to September 2016), we continued to monitor and send targeted
        e-mails to providers who accumulated &gt; 50 encounters. We modeled the financial
        impact of the intervention using net closure data, the report\u2019s aging
        function, and billing logs. <\/jats:p><\/jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Results:<\/jats:title><jats:p>
        InBasket monitoring with structured feedback decreased open encounters by
        53.43%. We did not see improvements in the other metrics that the report tracked.
        We estimate that $231,724 was saved as a result of the intervention and $349,179
        was lost to filing deadlines. <\/jats:p><\/jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Conclusion:<\/jats:title><jats:p>
        Automated e-mails did not reduce open encounters; targeted e-mails to providers

        lignocellulosic fibrous materials (LLFMs) offer a sustainable and biodegradable
        alternative in many applications. Enthusiastic interest in these materials
        has recently grown together with the newly risen interest in foam forming.
        Foam bubbles restrain fiber flocculation, and foam formed structures have
        high uniformity. Moreover, the bubbles support the fibrous structure during
        manufacturing enabling the formation of highly porous structures. Mechanical
        pressure cannot be applied in the manufacture of LLFMs as the materials would
        lose their porous structure. Water is therefore typically removed by a combination
        of drainage and thermal drying. Thermal drying of porous materials has been
        studied intensively. However, there are only a few studies on the drainage
        of fiber-laden foams. Thus, in this work, we conducted a systematic analysis
        of this topic. Our findings show that after drainage a stationary vertical
        moisture profile similar to that of pure foams is developed. Raising the initial
        fiber consistency was found to increase the final fiber consistency of the
        foam until the drainage ceased. Increasing mold height was found to increase
        the final consistency considerably. Without vacuum and heating, the shrinkage
        of samples during drainage was only slightly higher than the volume of the
        drained water. Drainage rate and final consistency increased clearly with
        increasing vacuum, but simultaneously sample shrinkage increased considerably.
        The best compromise was obtained with a vacuum of 0.5\u00a0kPa, which increased
        the final consistency by 60% without extra shrinkage. Using warm foam and
        heating the foam during drainage increased the final consistency considerably,
        but this also led to significant shrinkage of the sample.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1007\/s10570-020-03416-y","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2020,9,11]],"date-time":"2020-09-11T09:04:01Z","timestamp":1599815041000},"page":"9637-9652","update-policy":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1007\/springer_crossmark_policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":2,"title":["Drainage

        Sandwich plates are often analyzed with either classical or first order shear
        deformation theory. However experiments have shown that for lower stiffness
        cores and with concentrated loadings, these theories omit important features
        of the response. Recently a higher order theory for sandwich beams and plates
        has appeared in the literature that appears to better predict the response
        of sandwich structures. This theory treats the faces of the sandwich as independent
        orthotropic plates, coupled together by means of a simplified elasticity solution
        for the core that includes shear deformation and through-the-thickness strains.
        Analytical solutions for transverse static loading of plates can be obtained
        for simply-supported boundary conditions, analogous to the Navier solution.
        However the accuracy of this theory has not been sufficiently examined. In
        this paper the exact elasticity solution available for this problem is used
        to compare with the higher order sandwich theory. The results show that classical
        and first order shear deformation theory under-predict stresses and strains
        in the sandwich faces by more than an order of magnitude, while the higher
        order shear deformation theory is much more accurate. Although the higher
        order theory gives reasonable agreement with the elasticity solution, and
        is believed to be useful in practical application, it still gives errors on
        the order of 10 to 25% in face strains and interface shear stresses. The elasticity
        solution shows that the shear stress varies through the core thickness in
        the vicinity of localized loads, contrary to the assumptions of the higher
        order sandwich theory. <\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1177\/109963620000200306","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2009,8,24]],"date-time":"2009-08-24T23:56:37Z","timestamp":1251158197000},"page":"270-287","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":17,"title":["Response

        major advances in pharmacological and interventional therapies, 30% of hypertensive
        patients do not achieve their blood pressure (BP) target and have apparent
        treatment resistant hypertension (TRH). Thus, innovative strategies are urgently
        needed for the control of TRH considering its prevalence and deleterious complications.
        The objective of the current study was to evaluate effects of ADSC on BP in
        spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). The rational for using ADSC is that
        they have multipotent differentiation capacities and potent anti-inflammatory
        effects. Moreover, autologous ADSC are an attractive therapeutic option for
        clinical trials based on availability, less invasive isolation procedure,
        and safety in several hundred patient studies. ADSC were isolated from inguinal
        adipose tissue of a normotensive WKY rat, characterized using flow cytometry
        (CD44\n            <jats:sup>+<\/jats:sup>\n            ,CD90\n            <jats:sup>+<\/jats:sup>\n            ,CD34\n            <jats:sup>-<\/jats:sup>\n            and
        CD45\n            <jats:sup>-<\/jats:sup>\n            ), and their differentiation
        ability to adipocyte was confirmed by Oil Red \u201cO\u201d staining. Basal
        systolic BP for SHR at 13 week age was 191.6 \u00b1 5.6 mmHg measured by a
        tail-cuff method. SHR animals were then randomly assigned to control and ADSC-treated
        groups. ADSC (5\u044510\n            <jats:sup>6<\/jats:sup>\n            cells\/animal)
        was intravenously administered through jugular vein into treated SHR. Three
        weeks after treatment, left ventricular function was assessed using echocardiography
        and direct BP was measured using a Millar catheter. The SHR control exhibited
        82% increase in systolic BP (198.4 \u00b1 25.9 vs WKY: 109.0 \u00b1 1.6, mmHg)
        and 14% elevation in ventricular mass (3.3 \u00b1 0.2 vs WKY: 2.9 \u00b1 0.1,
        g\/kg). Furthermore, the SHR control demonstrated 42% increase in deceleration
        time of mitral valve (58.1 \u00b1 6.0 vs WKY: 40.8 \u00b1 2.3; ms) and 21%
        decrease in ejection fraction (69.9 \u00b1 4.2 vs WKY: 88.2 \u00b1 1.3, %).
        Single injection of ADSC resulted in a 28% decrease in systolic BP (142.5
        \u00b1 25.8mmHg), 18% reduction in ventricular mass (2.7 \u00b1 0.3g\/kg),
        36% decrease in deceleration time of mitral valve (36.9 \u00b1 16.3ms), and
        17% increase in ejection fraction (80.0 \u00b1 3.4%). Collectively, our data
        demonstrate that ADSC arrested the progression of hypertension and associated
        left ventricular dysfunction in the hypertensive animals. It warrants additional
        study on ADSC intervention as a potential alternative treatment for hypertension.\n          <\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1161\/hyp.64.suppl_1.060","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,3]],"date-time":"2021-07-03T09:13:05Z","timestamp":1625303585000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Abstract

        the field of ecology, the study of succession enjoys a fairly long history,
        certainly as long as ecology has been recognized as a discipline. Succession
        was discussed unofficially as early as the nineteenth century, but the term
        as we understand it today did not appear until the turn of the twentieth century
        (see History). Succession remains a core tenet within ecology, although it
        is sometimes subsumed with the broader discussion of vegetation dynamics.
        The early view that succession is a deterministic, predictable process has
        changed as ecologists now better appreciate the hierarchical, nonequilibrial
        nature of communities and ecosystems. Primary research has moved on from simply
        describing the patterns of primary and secondary successional change. Today\u2019s
        debates are dominated by the search for a mechanistic understanding and the
        application of successional theory for ecosystem management, rehabilitation,
        and restoration. The readings included in this bibliography on issues related
        to succession include the history of successional studies, primary and secondary
        succession, successional theory, and applications.<\/p>","DOI":"10.1093\/obo\/9780199830060-0001","type":"reference-entry","created":{"date-parts":[[2013,3,19]],"date-time":"2013-03-19T18:17:08Z","timestamp":1363717028000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Succession"],"prefix":"10.1093","author":[{"given":"David

        are defined by their arid conditions. However, deserts are not necessarily
        dry. It is the high evaporation relative to the precipitation that makes a
        desert such a harsh environment. Such evaporation occurs because deserts are
        often, but not always, hot, and because precipitation is low. A result of
        this aridity is that most of the area occupied by deserts is barren and monotonous.
        However, biologists perceive deserts to be laboratories of nature, where natural
        selection is exposed at its most extreme. Scientists have long considered
        the many unique adaptations of plants and animals for surviving the harsh
        desert environment. More recently, researchers have focused on the biotic
        interactions among organisms. Thus, the harsh abiotic environment defines
        the desert and imposes the strong selection pressures on organisms that live
        there. However, it is the relative simplicity of desert ecosystems that makes
        them frequently more tractable for study than more complex environments such
        as forests. According to Gideon Louw and Mary Seely\u2019s Ecology of Desert
        Organisms (Louw and Seely 1982, cited under General Overviews) and John Sowell\u2019s
        Desert Ecology (Sowell 2001, cited under Specific Deserts), most deserts have
        an average annual precipitation of less than 400 mm. A common definition distinguishes
        between true deserts, which receive less than 250 mm of average annual precipitation,
        and semideserts or steppes, which receive between 250 mm and 400 to 500 mm.
        Four factors influence the lack of rainfall in deserts: (1) the global atmospheric
        circulation maintains twin belts of dry, high-pressure air over the edges
        of the tropics, called Hadley cells; (2) marine circulation patterns contribute
        to aridity when cold coastal waters on the west coasts of North and South
        America, Africa, and Australia chill the air, reducing its moisture-carrying
        capacity; (3) rain shadows are created by mountain ranges; and (4) if the
        distances to the interior of a continent are too great (such as in the Gobi
        and Taklamakan deserts of China), then water is limited. Many of these four
        factors act in tandem. An additional type of desert is the polar desert, which
        occurs in the McMurdo dry valleys of Antarctica. This desert has extremely
        low humidity and no snow cover. Katabatic winds, which occur when cold and
        dense air is pulled down by gravity, heat as they descend and evaporate all
        moisture (see Doran, et al. 2002, cited under Defining the Desert Biome).
        These winds can reach speeds in excess of 300 km per hour. Here too, rain
        shadows are created by mountain ranges that are sufficiently high that the
        seaward-flowing ice is blocked from reaching the sea, thereby reducing humidity.<\/p>","DOI":"10.1093\/obo\/9780199830060-0044","type":"reference-entry","created":{"date-parts":[[2013,3,19]],"date-time":"2013-03-19T18:17:08Z","timestamp":1363717028000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Desert

        savanna biome represents the complex of vegetation made up of grassland with
        trees in varying densities and arrangements that occupies the transition zone
        between forests and grasslands. Whereas the lay observer could usually identify
        a forest or grassland, the savanna biome would provide a challenge, greatly
        influenced by the scale of observation, since it is characterized by high
        variability in density, arrangement, clumping, and structure of grassland
        and trees. The large-scale savannas of the world are quite different on the
        major continents of Africa, South America, and Australia, and distributed
        in smaller, highly variable arrangements and formations in North America and
        Eurasia. The nature and stability of the savanna biome has received increasing
        attention because of its perceived dependence on disturbance by fire and herbivory
        to maintain tree-grass balance and because some savannas are biodiversity
        hotspots. Evolution of savannas is thought to be associated with a lower CO2world
        where tropical grasses gain advantage from highly efficient photosynthetic
        systems and fire and grazing control woody encroachment. The explorer botanists
        of the early 20th century paid significant attention to the neotropical and
        peri-Amazonian savannas of South America with their extraordinary biodiversity.
        In the 1980s, the West African savannas became the terrestrial focus of the
        genesis of remote sensing of land systems and the development of the Normalized
        Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as a global monitoring tool. During the
        early to mid-20th century, many temperate savannas were heavily converted
        to agriculture in the New World, and a similar trend is now continuing and
        potentially accelerating in tropical savannas of South America and Africa.
        The Australian tropical savanna has remained largely intact as it is generally
        too arid for agricultural conversion. As a result it has become increasingly
        important for ecological and process studies on tree-grass ecosystem function
        across spatial scales. Tropical tall grass-tree systems in Asia tend to have
        been extirpated by dense human activity but have also been treated differently
        in vegetation classifications and so do not clearly appear in global land
        cover maps. There has been limited attention paid to these systems in the
        literature. With global population and food demand potentially ballooning
        in the 21st century, accelerated conversion of savannas is likely to intensify
        both concerns about decline in ecosystem function, and competition for ecosystem
        services that will necessitate a significant expansion in integrated, interdisciplinary
        research, sophisticated modeling and future scenario development and research
        on restoration ecology and amelioration of land degradation.<\/p>","DOI":"10.1093\/obo\/9780199830060-0043","type":"reference-entry","created":{"date-parts":[[2014,2,20]],"date-time":"2014-02-20T16:36:25Z","timestamp":1392914185000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Savanna

        explorers played a crucial role in both ecological transformations in the
        early modern era (c.\u00a01400\u20131800) and in scholars\u2019 ability to
        understand environmental change over time. Christopher Columbus, the most
        famous explorer in the history of the world, figured prominently in the growing
        European desire to lay claim to the Western Hemisphere and established a model
        of explorers who traveled far in the pursuit of gold, God, and glory. But
        he also solidified the role that explorers played in identifying species and
        in the initial transportation of biota, which produced a series of far-ranging
        impacts. Following in the wake of the pioneering work of the environmental
        historian Alfred Crosby, who developed the concept of the \u201cColumbian
        Exchange,\u201d scholars have written about the environmental consequences
        of long-distance travel, primarily (though not exclusively) of Europeans in
        the period often called the Age of Discovery. As many of these studies have
        revealed, the development of trade networks that spanned the oceans spurred
        unprecedented ecological change, including localized species depletion and
        alterations in climates long before observers such as Rachel Carson and Aldo
        Leopold called attention to detrimental human impact on the environment.<\/p>","DOI":"10.1093\/obo\/9780199830060-0136","type":"reference-entry","created":{"date-parts":[[2015,4,15]],"date-time":"2015-04-15T09:02:49Z","timestamp":1429088569000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["The

        inner-core thermodynamic structure of Hurricane Edouard (2014) is explored,
        primarily through an examination of both high-altitude dropsondes deployed
        during NASA\u2019s Hurricane and Severe Storm Sentinel (HS3) and a 60-member
        convection-permitting ensemble initialized with an ensemble Kalman filter.
        The 7-day forecasts are initialized coincident with Edouard\u2019s tropical
        depression designation and include Edouard\u2019s significant intensification
        to a major hurricane. Ten-member ensemble groups are created based on timing
        of near\u2013rapid intensification (RI) onset, and the associated composite
        inner-core temperature structures are analyzed. It is found that at Edouard\u2019s
        peak intensity, in both the observations and the simulations, the maximum
        inner-core perturbation temperature (~10\u201312 K) occurs in the midlevels
        (~4\u20138 km). In addition, in all composite groups that significantly intensify,
        the evolution of the area-averaged inner-core perturbation temperatures indicate
        that weak to moderate warming (at most 4 K) begins to occur in the low to
        midlevels (~2\u20136 km) ~24\u201348 h prior to RI, and this warming significantly
        strengthens and deepens (up to ~8 km) ~24 h after RI has begun. Despite broad
        similarities in the evolution of Edouard\u2019s warm core in these composites,
        variability in the height and strength of the maximum perturbation temperature
        and in the overall development of the inner-core temperature structure are
        present among the members of the composite groups (despite similar intensity
        time series). This result and concomitant correlation analyses suggest that
        the strength and height of the maximum perturbation temperature is not a significant
        causal factor for RI onset in this ensemble. Fluctuations in inner-core temperature
        structure occur either in tandem with or after significant intensity changes.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1175\/mwr-d-17-0095.1","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2017,11,3]],"date-time":"2017-11-03T18:10:17Z","timestamp":1509732617000},"page":"135-155","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":9,"title":["The
