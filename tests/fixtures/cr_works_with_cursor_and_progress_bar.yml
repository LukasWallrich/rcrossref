        is a world of sights and sounds. We live by our eyes and ears and tend generally
        to be oblivious to the chemical happenings in our surrounds. Such happenings
        are ubiquitous. All organisms engender chemical signals, and all, in their
        respective ways, respond to the chemical emissions of others. The result is
        a vast communicative interplay, fundamental to the fabric of life\u201d (Eisner
        and Meinwald 1995, p. v), cited under General Overviews). Chemical ecology
        is the study of ecological interactions between organisms mediated by chemicals
        produced by those organisms. Chemical interactions between organisms can be
        analyzed across all organizational levels, reaching from cell-cell interaction
        and intraspecific and multitrophic-level interactions to whole community interactions
        and environmental ecological processes. Because of their ubiquity, chemical
        signals that carry information (semiochemicals) can be categorized by the
        types of ecological interactions they mediate, such as intraspecific social
        communication, antagonistic interactions, and mutualism. Accordingly, this
        article is organized into three core areas, one formed by the chemicals mediating
        interactions between members of the same species (pheromones), and the others
        by interspecific interactions involving allomones (where the sender benefits),
        and synomones (where both sender and receivers benefit). A fourth group of
        signals, kairomones (where the receiver benefits), can comprise all other
        signal categories when they are perceived and utilized by a third organism
        that itself gains a benefit from eavesdropping on communication between others.
        While primary studies in chemical ecology focused on the identification of
        compounds mediating interactions between organisms, today\u2019s debates are
        dominated by micro- and macroevolutionary aspects of chemical interactions.
        The very rapid growth of the chemical ecology literature over recent decades
        has been, in part, driven by the growing appreciation of the high economic
        value of understanding chemical communication, reaching from applications
        in pest management over the control of disease vectors in agriculture to the
        use of chemical signals in medicine. Moreover, the field has dramatically
        profited from innovations in analytical chemistry, making the separation of
        complex compound mixtures as well as the identification of compound structures
        efficient and accessible to a broader community of researchers. Recent advances
        in molecular ecology have aided an even more rapid mechanistic and functional
        analysis of semiochemicals, leading to a modern consolidation of different
        research fields. This collection of significant publications focuses on the
        functional and evolutionary analysis of chemical signals important in mediating
        ecological interactions. Moreover, attention has been given to publications
        that provide conceptual frameworks and are among the most highly cited in
        the respective subdisciplines. They can thus provide a good introduction for
        the interested reader and allow efficient forward and backward searching for
        more detailed information.<\/p>","DOI":"10.1093\/obo\/9780199830060-0023","type":"reference-entry","created":{"date-parts":[[2013,3,19]],"date-time":"2013-03-19T18:17:08Z","timestamp":1363717028000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Chemical

        ecology is a branch of study and thinking within the ecological sciences that
        focuses on the ecosystem\u2014a dynamic network of interactions of organisms
        and their environment\u2014and the importance of these interactions to the
        organisms and earth system processes. The discipline represents one of two
        different epistemological approaches within ecology that emerged in the 20th
        century: a species-centric community-based approach, and a process-centric
        ecosystem-based approach. Both approaches study the ways in which species
        interact among themselves and their environment, share a common language,
        and share a common set of principles. The community-based approach focuses
        on how species\u2019 distributions and abundances are shaped by their resource
        needs and tolerances to environmental conditions, and by their interactions
        with other species. The ecosystem-based approach represents a significant
        departure in that it considers both the resource needs and tolerances of species
        and their interactions with other species, but also factors in the contributions
        that species make to earth system processes (e.g., biogeochemical cycles,
        climate). The two perspectives are not as mutually exclusive as the phrasing
        of the approaches suggests, but rather offer different approaches to how we
        view the environment and communities and the factors that regulate them. In
        the 21st century, modern ecosystem science includes the influences that humans
        have as part of ecological communities and as drivers of change in ecological
        communities. This linkage within the ecosystem perspective of biology affecting
        the physical environment, and the recent developments that include the social
        and human dimensions, has positioned the approach as a critical one in understanding
        the relationship among global processes and the services that ecosystems provide
        to human well-being that is embodied in the emerging science of sustainability.<\/p>","DOI":"10.1093\/obo\/9780199830060-0202","type":"reference-entry","created":{"date-parts":[[2018,8,28]],"date-time":"2018-08-28T09:14:08Z","timestamp":1535447648000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Ecosystem

        natural disturbance agents include wildfire, wind, landslides, snow avalanches,
        volcanoes, flooding, and other weather-related phenomena. Fire is of particular
        interest because of its antiquity, its natural role in many terrestrial ecosystems,
        its long-term use by humans to modify vegetation, and its potentially serious
        threat to life and property. Fire ecology is the art and science of understanding
        natural and human fire history and fire effects on the environment, species,
        ecosystems, and landscapes. This knowledge aids the development of fire and
        ecosystem management plans and activities. Fire history is determined by a
        number of techniques that use available physical or cultural evidence to examine
        particular temporal and spatial scales. Fire effects on the environment and
        organisms are determined by observation and experimentation, but the findings
        are variable and often contradictory. Fire regimes are used to characterize
        the role of fire in specific ecosystems and can help guide ecosystem restoration
        activities. Attitudes toward fire have evolved over time, as good and bad
        experiences combined with improved scientific understanding to influence our
        perspectives. Natural disturbances came to be viewed as integral parts of
        ecosystems rather than external perturbations. We now strive to allow fire
        to maintain its natural role in wilderness areas and parks and also to emulate
        natural disturbances, such as fire, when designing forest harvesting operations.

        the beginning of the 20th century there was much debate about the \u201cnature\u201d
        of communities. The driving question was whether the community was a self-organized
        system of co-occurring species or simply a haphazard collection of populations
        with minimal functional integration. At that time, two extreme views dominated
        the discussion: one view considered a community as a superorganism, the member
        species of which were tightly bound together by interactions that contributed
        to repeatable patterns of species abundance in space and time. This concept
        led to the assumption that communities are fundamental entities, to be classified
        as the Linnaean taxonomy of species. Frederick E. Clements was one of the
        leading proponents of this approach, and his view became known as the organismic
        concept of communities. This assumes a common evolutionary history for the
        integrated species. The opposite view was the individualistic continuum concept,
        advocated by H.\u00a0A. Gleason. His focus was on the traits of individual
        species that allow each to live within specific habitats or geographical ranges.
        In this view a community is an assemblage of populations of different species
        whose traits allow persisting in a prescribed area. The spatial boundaries
        are not sharp, and the species composition can change considerably. Consequently,
        it was discussed whether ecological communities were sufficiently coherent
        entities to be considered appropriate study objects. Later, consensus was
        reached: that properties of communities are of central interest in ecology,
        regardless of their integrity and coherence. From the 1950s and 1960s onward,
        the discussion was dominated by the deterministic outcome of local interactions
        between species and their environments and the building of this into models
        of communities. This approach, indicated as \u201ctraditional community ecology,\u201d
        led to a morass of theoretical models, without being able to provide general
        principles about many-species communities. Early-21st-century approaches to
        bringing general patterns into community ecology concern (1) the metacommunity
        approach, (2) the functional trait approach, (3) evolutionary community ecology,
        and (4) the four fundamental processes. The metacommunity approach implicitly
        recognizes and studies the important role of spatiotemporal dynamics. In the
        functional trait approach, four themes are focused upon: traits, environmental
        gradients, the interaction milieu, and performance currencies. This functional,
        trait-focused approach should have a better prospect of understanding the
        effects of global changes. Evolutionary community ecology is an approach in
        which the combination of community ecology and evolutionary biology will lead
        to a better understanding of the complexity of communities and populations.
        The four fundamental processes are selection, drift, speciation, and dispersal.
        This approach concerns an organizational scheme for community ecology, based
        on these four processes to describe all existing specific models and frameworks,

        ecology is a rapidly developing subdiscipline of ecology concerned with how
        species interactions and abiotic components of the environment affect patterns
        and processes of disease. To date, disease ecology has focused largely on
        infectious disease. The scientific study of infectious disease has a long
        history dominated by specialists on the taxa of infectious agents (e.g., bacteriologists,
        virologists), mechanisms of host defense (e.g., immunologists), effects of
        infection on individual hosts (e.g., pathologists), effects on host populations
        (epidemiologists), and treatment (e.g., practicing physicians and veterinarians).
        Disease ecology arose as scientists increasingly recognized that the interactions
        between pathogen and host could be conceptually united with other interspecific
        interactions, such as those between predator and prey, competitors, or mutualists.
        At its simplest, an infectious disease consists of an interaction between
        one species of pathogen and one species of host. The evolution of disease
        ecology since the late 20th century has incorporated additional layers of
        complexity, including recognition that most pathogens infect multiple species
        of host, that hosts are infected with multiple pathogens, and that abiotic
        conditions (e.g., temperature, moisture) interact with biotic conditions to
        affect transmission and disease. As a consequence, a framework broader than
        the simplest host-pathogen system is often required to understand disease
        dynamics. Disease ecologists are interested both in the ecological causes
        of disease patterns (for instance, how the population density of a host influences
        transmission rates), and the ecological consequences of disease (for instance,
        how the population dynamics of a host species change as an epidemic progresses).
        Consequently, disease ecology today often integrates across several levels
        of biological organization, from molecular mechanisms of pathology and immunity;
        to individual-organism changes in health, survival, and reproduction; to population
        dynamics of hosts and pathogens; to community dynamics of hosts and pathogens;
        to impacts of disease on ecosystem processes; to ecosystem-level effects of
        climate change and landscape change on disease.<\/p>","DOI":"10.1093\/obo\/9780199830060-0128","type":"reference-entry","created":{"date-parts":[[2015,2,3]],"date-time":"2015-02-03T11:57:47Z","timestamp":1422964667000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Disease

        on classifications) range from 30 to 70 percent of the terrestrial land surface
        and show a major presence on five continents. In grasslands and savanna ecosystems,
        the grazing energy channel is prominent (~50 percent of energy flows through
        herbivores), unlike energy flow in more arid ecosystems where the detrital
        energy channel predominates. While variable, estimates of consumption of above-ground
        net primary productivity (ANPP) by native large mammal herbivores ranges from
        1 (desert grassland) to ~64 percent (mesic grasslands), and cattle remove

        both native and exotic. Examples of each of these responses are provided in

        in grazing ecology are wide ranging, where both plant and grazer responses
        are studied as we attempt to integrate the many moving parts operating at
        multiple scales to understand responses from multiple perspectives. These
        include an understanding of the role of disturbances (fire, drought, herbivory),
        internal dynamics driving fire-grazer interactions, variable environmental
        conditions (especially primary production and rainfall), resource heterogeneity
        at multiple spatial scales, variable herbivore body size, different digestive
        physiologies of herbivores, sedentary presence and migratory movement of large
        mammalian herbivores in response to variable environmental conditions, and
        trophic control of food webs including bottom-up\/top-down regulation with
        important roles for direct and indirect species interactions. Combined, many
        factors contribute to a range of equilibrial and nonequilibrial interpretations
        of key responses and patterns of grazing ecology with important implications
        for management and conservation of these systems worldwide. Much of grazing
        ecology focuses on the interactions of large mammal herbivores with vegetation
        structure and plant communities. Much less is known about invertebrate grazers,

        have become an urban species, but this is a rather recent phenomena. The first
        cities appeared around six thousand years ago and while their number increased,
        their population remained relatively small. This changed in the industrial
        revolution and today cities are home to more than 50 percent of the world\u2019s
        human population. Considering that most people live in cities and that ecology
        has been around for more than one hundred years, it seems obvious to have
        a subdiscipline called urban ecology. Not until the 1960s and 1970s, however,
        did urban ecology fully emerge and not until the 1990s did it become wildly
        popular. Most ecologists shunned urban areas, which have traditionally been
        viewed in opposition to natural, pristine, and wilderness places. It is true
        enough that water, air, and soil in cities are often polluted, open spaces
        are scarce and heavily managed, and communities resemble a wild mix of native
        and non-native species. It took a while until ecologists perceived this not
        just as a mess, but also as a research opportunity for understanding key ecological
        principles. Such principles are treated in separate Oxford Bibliographies
        in Ecology articles \u201cCompetition and Coexistence in Animal Communities,\u201d

        The study of these phenomena is often referred to as ecology in cities. In
        the 1970s, a broader, interdisciplinary perspective took hold. It is often
        referred to as ecology of cities and understands urban areas as social-ecological
        systems. This shift in perspective stemmed from a recognition that people
        are influencing ecosystems everywhere on earth. In fact, cities are at the
        heart of many environmental problems and, therefore, they are a good place
        to look for solutions. Today, urban ecology is a key discipline for an urban
        planet. The need to adapt cities to climate change, maintain vegetation in
        the face of climate extremes, balance the need for development with the need
        for green space, or decrease the negative local-to-global environmental impacts
        of cities can be achieved without the interdisciplinary perspective urban
        ecology provides. This article gives an overview of the ever-increasing urban
        ecology literature. Of course, the list is subjective, reflecting our academic

        ecosystems comprise only 3\u20135 percent of the world\u2019s land surface,
        but their unique habitats and specialized and rare species have garnered the
        attention of biologists for centuries. The use of wetlands in Europe and Asia
        has a deep history, as draining peat bogs, marshes, mires, and swamps for
        fuel, timber, and agricultural crops was common practice. The first academic
        use of the word wetlands appears in Catesby\u2019s 1754 book The Natural History
        of Carolina, Florida and the Bahamas Islands, and early studies of wetlands
        focused on the distinct flora and fauna found in these ecosystems, with a
        particular emphasis on waterfowl, fish, or other game. Illustrating this point
        is the first major assessment and classification of wetlands across the United
        States in 1956, which is solely based on waterfowl habitat value. Research
        on wetlands quickly evolved in the 1960s and 1970s to become a distinct subdiscipline
        of the burgeoning field of ecology. Fueled by the concept of wetlands as \u201cMother
        Nature\u2019s kidneys,\u201d and by their potential for cheap wastewater treatment,
        there was an initial focus on their biogeochemical and hydrologic functions
        on the landscape, as well as the nutrient removal or transformation services
        they provided. Research in both Europe and the United States also focused
        on how plants and animals survived the alternating wet\/dry soil regimes wetlands
        possessed and demonstrated that wide-ranging soil redox conditions were microbial
        driven and produced either reduced or oxidized chemical ions, often with toxic
        or altered properties, depending on the presence or absence of oxygen and
        alternate electron acceptors like nitrate or iron. These findings led to a
        number of elegant studies focusing on the ecophysiology of how wetland plants
        and animals survived anaerobic conditions, the presence of toxic chemicals,
        and saline conditions found in coastal marshes. Since the 1990s, research
        has focused more on biogeochemical cycling in wetlands, especially nitrogen,
        phosphorus, and, more recently, carbon flux and storage as it relates to global
        climate change, as it became understood that wetland soils are globally important
        stores of carbon and sources of atmospheric methane, a potent greenhouse gas.
        Thus, global warming effects on boreal and tropical wetlands and continued
        drainage of these ecosystems worldwide have become a major area of concern,
        along with the effects of sea level rise on coastal wetland survival. To offset
        these losses, the fields of wetland restoration and ecologic economics have
        become increasing relevant.<\/p>","DOI":"10.1093\/obo\/9780199830060-0220","type":"reference-entry","created":{"date-parts":[[2019,7,31]],"date-time":"2019-07-31T07:27:24Z","timestamp":1564558044000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Wetland

        ecology (IE) tracks physical resource flows of industrial and consumer systems
        at a variety of spatial scales, drawing on environmental and social science,
        engineering, management, and policy analysis. Prescriptively, IE seeks to
        reduce environmental impacts and the pressure on natural resources while maintaining
        function for human well-being, by stressing the importance of production choices
        to extend the life of embedded materials and energy, emphasizing circular
        rather than linear flows, and decoupling economic growth from resource use.
        IE has been described as a \u201cpost-modern science\u201d that synthesizes
        multiple perspectives in theory and problem solving, often simultaneously,
        as a multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary, and transdisciplinary field. The
        unusual name \u201cindustrial ecology\u201d derives from a metaphor with the
        biological ecosystem and borrows on several fronts, such as its focus on resource
        cycling, multi-scalar systems, material and energy stocks and flows, and food
        webs. Over time concepts from other sciences have also been weaved into industrial
        ecology. The intellectual roots of industrial ecology date back to the 19th
        century, and some seminal methods were published in the 1960s and 1970s. It
        took until the early 1990s, however, before a scientific field began to take
        shape. Since its early days, industrial ecology has become more robust through
        database development, deeper mathematical modeling, collaboration among natural,
        physical, and social scientists, and extension of theory on its own and in
        dialogue with other allied fields. At the same time, industrial ecology increasingly
        contributes insights to environmental management and policy, on issues ranging
        from climate change, to biodiversity loss, water, and more. Despite its youth,
        breadth, and intersection with other disciplines, industrial ecology can lay
        claim to several subfields as being within its ambit: industrial symbiosis,
        which studies the exchange of byproducts and sharing of resources among industrial
        actors; socioeconomic metabolism and material flows analysis, focusing on
        the stocks and flows of various materials through society; life-cycle assessment,
        examining the environmental impact of a material, product, or system across
        its entire life cycle; environmental input-output analysis, broadly focused
        on the environmental impact of entire sectors of the economy; sustainable
        urban systems, with focus on metabolism of resources at the urban scale; and
        resource productivity and circular economy, addressing the effectiveness of
        resource use while decreasing its impact. In addition to these core subfields,
        other topics are more loosely linked with industrial ecology, including green
        chemistry, life-cycle engineering, social ecology, design for environment,

        study of soil ecology has a long tradition. Most of this interest, until relatively
        recently, has been from an agricultural perspective, but now it is widely
        accepted that soil ecology is central to the study of terrestrial ecology.
        Early research in soil ecology was largely descriptive, detailing the abundance
        of diversity of organisms in soils of different habitats. However, interest
        in functional soil ecology started in the 1980s with studies of trophic interactions
        in soil and their importance for nutrient cycles and decomposition. Now, the
        topic has blossomed, with the help of new technologies that allow the study
        of soil organisms and their activities in situ, and there is currently widespread
        recognition that soil ecology is fundamental to our understanding of the functioning
        of terrestrial ecosystems and their response to global change. Today, the
        field of soil ecology is dominated by discussions on the use of new molecular
        tools that enable ecologists to understand what regulates patterns of diversity
        in soil, the functional role of soil biodiversity and plant-soil interactions,
        especially those that occur at the root-soil interface, and the role of soil
        biological communities in regulating ecosystem responses to global change,
        including the global carbon cycle under climate change. Many challenges still
        remain in soil ecology, and perhaps the most significant is the need for a
        stronger theoretical basis for the subject; almost all studies in this area
        have been carried out from an empirical perspective, and modeling approaches
        are still in their infancy. As a consequence, our ability to make predictions
        about the role of soil biological interactions and feedbacks in regulating

        all heterotrophs, mostly exist as biologically separate and genetically distinct
        individuals, and most are sexual. There are greater or lesser exceptions to
        all of these features, but they unify the phenomena of animal populations,
        and make counting individuals an intuitive and practical way of accounting
        for their populations\u2019 growth and numbers. That part of ecology that
        deals with populations of animals is thus an interesting partition, and as
        a distinct area of study is well-justified by historical development and current
        practice.<\/p>","DOI":"10.1093\/obo\/9780199830060-0192","type":"reference-entry","created":{"date-parts":[[2018,1,11]],"date-time":"2018-01-11T08:57:22Z","timestamp":1515661042000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Animal

        academic disciplines ecology and wildlife ecology both recognize the importance
        of habitat to the daily survival of individuals and long-term persistence
        of populations. Although the explicit and direct study of habitat originally
        emerged in ecology, wildlife ecologists historically have been more involved
        in its study and in the analysis of species\u2013habitat relationships. This
        is partly due to wildlife ecologists being interested in habitat management
        for particular species and applying a resource-based concept of habitat to
        better understand population growth rates, particularly for harvested or hunted
        species. In the 1930s onward for several decades, Aldo Leopold played a prominent
        role in establishing wildlife ecology (and management) as its own academic
        field and practice. Leopold was keenly aware of population dynamics although
        he seemed to not directly link his empirical observations of population fluctuations
        to any of the emerging mathematical population growth models of the day. This
        may have also indirectly allowed the early growth of wildlife ecology to proceed
        without any of its own emergent theory. Despite historical, paradigmatic,
        practical, and subject matter differences between the two disciplines, both
        are becoming more similar to one another as interdisciplinary collaboration
        and communication continue to increase.<\/p>","DOI":"10.1093\/oso\/9780198829287.003.0002","type":"book-chapter","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,18]],"date-time":"2021-02-18T03:47:01Z","timestamp":1613620021000},"page":"29-38","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Ecology

        along the southern coast of Brazil, into Argentina and Paraguay, the Atlantic
        Forest is a domain that once covered 150 Mha and includes many distinct forest
        subtypes and ecosystems. Its large latitudinal (29\u02da) and altitudinal
        (0\u20132,800 m above sea level) range, as well as complex topography in the
        region, has created microclimates within forest subtypes, which has led to
        biodiversity specifically adapted to narrow ecological ranges. The region
        is incredibly species-rich and is home to charismatic or economically important
        species such as the black and golden lion tamarin, the red-browned Amazon
        parrot, and the highly prized palm heart from Euterpe edulis. Through widespread
        human-driven change dating back to the arrival of European settlers in 1500,
        this realm has been extensively reduced, fragmented, and modified. Nowadays,
        this region is home to about 130 million people (60 percent of the Brazilian
        population) and is responsible for producing 70 percent of Brazil\u2019s GDP,
        putting a strain on natural resources and providing challenges to conservation.
        Due to its high levels of endemic species coupled with a high threat of habitat
        loss and fragmentation, the Atlantic Forest has been identified as a \u201cbiodiversity
        hotspot.\u201d Numerous studies have assessed the effects of habitat transformation
        on biodiversity and the consensus is that the majority of species are negatively
        affected. It is puzzling however that few species have actually gone extinct
        in the wild, even if some extinctions might have gone undetected. Extinctions
        do not immediately follow habitat change, there is often a time lag of many
        decades between habitat transformation and extinction. This may suggest that
        many species in the Atlantic Forest are \u201cliving deads,\u201d as despite
        their presence the available habitat no longer supports their requirements.
        It also suggests that there is a window of opportunity to restoring the domain
        to avert extinctions before they are realized. Current research and policy
        actions are geared toward optimizing restoration and increasing the extent
        of native forest cover, bringing hope to the conservation of this unique domain.<\/p>","DOI":"10.1093\/obo\/9780199830060-0233","type":"reference-entry","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,13]],"date-time":"2021-01-13T01:43:53Z","timestamp":1610502233000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Ecology

        against contemporary versions of a dark ecology, the chapter shows the inherent
        luminism of Guattari\u2019s ecosophy, which it develops from within the complementarity
        of the differently luminous planes of immanence and of consistency. Drawing
        on Guattari\u2019s ecologization of the notion of the abstract machine, the
        chapter turns to architecture as a testing site of the alignment of given
        world and giving creatures. A reading of Guattari\u2019s writings on architecture
        shows that a schizoecological architecture should be, like ecology itself,
        both intensely impersonal and intensely personal, both intensely abstract
        and concrete. After tracing the conceptual architectures of the La Borde clinic,
        it develops, against recent theories of an all-encompassing and all-pervading
        capitalism, the theory of a time- and site-specific capitalism, and, set against

        and evolution go hand in hand. However, since evolution occurs over relatively
        long time scales, ecologists had long thought it unlikely that evolutionary
        events could affect population dynamics or species interactions in ecological
        time. This view is changing. Today, there are multiple areas of research examining
        how evolutionary processes feedback directly on ecology. For example, eco-evolutionary
        dynamics focus on the cyclical interaction between ecology and adaptive evolution,
        such that changes in ecological interactions drive selection on organismal
        traits that, in turn, alter the outcome of ecological interactions. Striking
        examples of eco-evolutionary feedbacks are found in predator\u2013prey interactions
        of laboratory populations. However, less is known about eco-evolutionary feedbacks
        in nature. Evolutionary rescue describes a process whereby rapid adaptation
        may prevent extinction in a changing environment. Other topics covered in
        this chapter are community phylogenetics and the evolution of regional species

        is one of the most important environmental factors limiting the growth and
        production of terrestrial (land) plants. Although water is essential for a
        number of metabolic, physiological, and growth processes in plants (e.g.,
        turgor maintenance and cell elongation, transport of nutrients and carbohydrates,
        energy dissipation, and photosynthetic electron transport), most plants consume
        and store very little water. The vast majority of water that is absorbed by
        a plant\u2019s root system moves through its vascular tissue (xylem) and is
        lost to the atmosphere as water vapor in the process of transpiration. It
        is the net difference between this uptake and loss that determines the overall
        water balance of a plant. Plant species vary considerably in their abilities
        to capture soil water, how efficiently they utilize water, and their tolerances
        to desiccation, and this variation has a number of ecological consequences
        at scales from individual plants to ecosystems, landscapes, and the globe.
        Historically, plant physiological ecologists studied the water relations of
        plant cells, tissues, and organs to better understand the molecular, physiological,
        anatomical, and morphological mechanisms by which plants have adapted to survive
        drought and cope with limited water availability. For obvious reasons, these
        studies were concentrated on plants in extreme moisture-limited ecosystems
        such as deserts, but water relations research was also conducted in other
        systems that experience intermittent and seasonal drought. Over time, physiological
        ecologists began to study the water relationships between plants and soil,
        examined how plants interacted with one another for this resource, and explored
        how temporal and spatial variation in soil moisture availability influences
        species distributions and community organization. The study of ecohydrology
        is a relatively recent interdisciplinary discipline that seeks to study how
        hydrological processes influence biological communities and also how these
        systems, in turn, influence the water cycle. Plant physiological ecologists
        play an important role in ecohydrology research by studying how water influences
        ecosystem function and quantifying the role of vegetation in influencing hydrological
        processes. Finally, plant physiological ecologists are increasingly interested
        in how changes in water availability driven by climate change affects plants
        and terrestrial ecosystems, how global change factors (e.g., atmospheric CO2)
        influence plant water relations, and what role vegetation itself plays in
        influencing the atmosphere and climate. Below are selected sources that highlight
        the full breadth of the study of the physiological ecology of water balance
        in plants. An emphasis is placed on terrestrial plants in non-hydric (i.e.,
        non-flooded) environments and sources include a number of classical as well

        were humanity\u2019s earliest energy carrier in the form of firewood. Forest
        biomass energy was the dominant energy form used in the United Kingdom, United
        States, and other industrialized countries before the Industrial Revolution
        when coal took over. Traditional biomass energy resources such as firewood
        and straw still dominate energy consumption today in sub-Saharan Africa, Myanmar,
        Nepal, Pakistan, Cambodia, Guatemala, and Haiti, and it is the largest renewable
        energy source used worldwide. However, biomass energy sources are not always
        used sustainably. Since these energy sources are used for heating and cooking,
        they can be considered biofuel, though most 21st-century analysts more commonly
        think of biofuel as alternative transportation fuels such as ethanol, biodiesel,
        methanol, and biobutanol. These modern, \u201cadvanced\u201d forms of biofuel
        are divided into \u201cfirst generation\u201d\u2014based on food sources such
        as starch, sugar, animal fats, and vegetable oils (especially corn oil, soy
        oil, and sugarcane); \u201csecond generation\u201d\u2014based on non-food
        feedstocks such as lignocellulosic biomass (e.g., agricultural and forestry
        residues, short rotation woody crops, Miscanthus and switchgrass); and \u201cthird
        generation\u201d\u2014based on algae and synthetic biology. This bibliography
        will address the considerable scholarship and special concerns raised by ecologists
        over biofuel feedstock production and use. To accurately analyze the ecological
        effects of biofuel crop growth, baseline land use, and indirect land-use change
        caused by their production must be considered. It should also be noted that
        biofuel crops produce multiple products that are used in multiple markets,
        including human food, animal feed, specialty chemicals, electricity, among
        others. Since biofuels and ecology is a somewhat interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary
        subject, however, not all works listed herein have been authored by ecologists.

        overviews written by ecologists on the topic. Following that, we will list
        some of the major journals that have published much of the leading scholarship
        on biofuels and ecology. The rest of this review is divided into four main
        sections, though these are not mutually exclusive: Land Use and Land-Use Change,
        Ecosystem Services, Biodiversity, and Alternative Ecologies. In each section,
        relevant subthemes of importance to ecologists will be identified and discussed.<\/p>","DOI":"10.1093\/obo\/9780199830060-0212","type":"reference-entry","created":{"date-parts":[[2019,3,28]],"date-time":"2019-03-28T08:58:34Z","timestamp":1553763514000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Biofuels"],"prefix":"10.1093","member":"286","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2019,3,27]]},"container-title":["Ecology"],"original-title":["Biofuels"],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,25]],"date-time":"2021-05-25T07:39:53Z","timestamp":1621928393000},"score":10.044421,"issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,3,27]]},"references-count":0,"URL":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1093\/obo\/9780199830060-0212","published":{"date-parts":[[2019,3,27]]}},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,10]],"date-time":"2021-05-10T19:17:18Z","timestamp":1620674238686},"reference-count":0,"publisher":"Edinburgh

        move, and their movement can take place by walking, swimming, or flying; via
        transport by another organism (phoresy); or by a vehicle such as wind or current
        (Dingle 1996). The functions of movement include finding food or mates, escaping
        from predators or deteriorating habitats, the avoidance of inbreeding, and
        the invasion and colonization of new areas. Virtually all life functions require
        at least some movement, so it is hardly surprising that organisms have evolved
        a number of structures, devices, and behaviors to facilitate it. The behavior
        of individuals while moving and the way this behavior is incorporated into
        life histories form one part of this chapter. This discussion focuses on the
        action of selection on the evolution of individual behavior, on how specific
        kinds of movement can be identified from the underlying behavior and physiology,
        and on the functions of the various movement behaviors. The other major part
        of our discussion focuses on the consequences of movement behaviors for the
        ecology and dynamics of populations. The pathways of the moving individuals
        within it can result in quite different outcomes for a population. First,
        movements may disperse the members of the population and increase the mean
        distances among them. The separation may be a result of paths more-or- less
        randomly chosen by organisms as they seek resources, or it may be a consequence
        of organisms avoiding one another. In contrast to dispersing them, movement
        may also bring individuals together either because they clump or congregate
        in the same habitat patch or because they actively aggregate through mutual
        attraction. Clumping can also lead to aggregation and mutually attracting
        social interactions. A classic example is the gregarious (aggregating) phase
        of the desert locust (Schistocerca gregaria), in which huge swarms of many
        millions of individuals first congregate in suitable habitats and then develop
        and retain cohesion based on mutual attraction. The foraging swarms make the
        locust a devastating agricultural pest over much of Africa and the Middle
        East (Farrow 1990; Dingle 1996). It is the aggregation of locusts that makes
        them such destructive pests; they would be far less harmful if the populations
        dispersed.<\/p>","DOI":"10.1093\/oso\/9780195131543.003.0025","type":"book-chapter","created":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,11]],"date-time":"2020-11-11T01:07:04Z","timestamp":1605056824000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["The

        patterns are ubiquitous in nature, and ecological systems exhibit patchiness
        (heterogeneity) across a range of spatial and temporal scales. Landscape ecology
        is explicitly concerned with understanding how scale affects the measurement
        of heterogeneity and the scale(s) at which spatial pattern is important for
        ecological phenomena. Patterns and processes measured at fine spatial scales
        and over short time periods are unlikely to behave similarly at broader scales
        and extended time periods. An understanding of pattern-process linkages, a
        major research focus in landscape ecology, thus requires an understanding
        of how patterns change with scale, spatially and temporally. The development
        of methods for extrapolating information across scales is necessary for predicting
        how landscapes will change over time as well as for ecological forecasting.
        This chapter explores how scaling issues affect ecological investigations,
        discusses problems in identifying the correct scale for research, and outlines
        when and how ecological data can be extrapolated.<\/p>","DOI":"10.1093\/oso\/9780198838388.003.0002","type":"book-chapter","created":{"date-parts":[[2019,8,21]],"date-time":"2019-08-21T07:28:41Z","timestamp":1566372521000},"page":"14-41","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Scaling

        is a foundational concept in animal behavior and behavioral ecology. Territoriality
        is commonly defined as \u201cthe defense of an area,\u201d wherein the area
        being defended is known as the \u201cterritory.\u201d Territoriality serves
        as a framework that allows animal behaviorists and behavioral ecologists to
        describe and hypothesize links among diverse aspects of animals\u2019 biology.
        The many facets and functions of territoriality include the acquisition of
        food, nest sites, and shelter, space-use and movement behavior, and interactions
        with mates and competitors. Thus, because territoriality encompasses behaviors
        that directly determine individuals\u2019 survival and reproduction (i.e.,
        their fitness), it offers a powerful approach to understanding the evolution
        of animal behavior. Territoriality has been used to describe animal behavior
        for many centuries, particularly in avian systems; conversely, many advances
        in how biologists conceive of and use territoriality have arisen in research
        on birds. Operational definitions of territory fall broadly into two categories\u2014those
        that focus on animals\u2019 behavior and those that focus on their ecological
        relationships. That said, the question of how to conceive of territory has
        long been a subject of contention, with widely varied opinions on how the
        term should be defined and whether and how it is useful for understanding
        animal behavior. Discussions and critiques of territoriality, from not only
        animal behavior and behavioral ecology but also from the social sciences,
        help to contextualize and sharpen how we use the concept to understand the
        evolution of animal behavior. Technological and statistical advances continue
        to change the ways in which territories are mapped and quantified, with different
        methods available for taxa of different sizes, habitats, and life histories.
        Research on territoriality can be divided into two large domains based on
        the function served by territory\u2014foraging and mating\u2014but these two
        functions are intimately linked through the socioecological hypothesis that
        proposes a relationship between resource distributions and mating systems.
        This hypothesis has served to structure much research on territoriality in
        the last half-century or so. Finally, territoriality is pertinent not just
        to within-species interactions but also to between-species interactions and
        species coexistence, with implications for macroecological and macroevolutionary
        patterns and processes.<\/p>","DOI":"10.1093\/obo\/9780199830060-0230","type":"reference-entry","created":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,25]],"date-time":"2020-03-25T10:49:45Z","timestamp":1585133385000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Territoriality"],"prefix":"10.1093","author":[{"given":"Ambika","family":"Kamath","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]}],"member":"286","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,25]]},"container-title":["Ecology"],"original-title":["Territoriality"],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,25]],"date-time":"2020-03-25T10:49:45Z","timestamp":1585133385000},"score":9.843613,"issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,25]]},"references-count":0,"URL":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1093\/obo\/9780199830060-0230","published":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,25]]}},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,27]],"date-time":"2021-07-27T12:40:45Z","timestamp":1627389645109},"reference-count":0,"publisher":"Oxford

        engineering is a hybrid discipline developed for solving certain kinds of
        environmental problems. The conceptual basis is to engineer solutions that
        incorporate ecosystems that are fueled by natural energies such as sunlight
        into the design. The creation of ecologically engineered ecosystems includes
        both restoration of past systems for conservation and the design of new systems
        that address environmental problems. The goal is to create designs that are
        cost effective and that provide multiple benefits to society. Where applicable
        ecological engineered systems are intended to be alternatives to conventional
        technologies that rely on higher inputs of fossil fuel energies. As with other
        kinds of engineering, ecologically engineered systems require quantitative
        methods of design such as sizing, optimization, and input-output balances.
        However, because ecologically engineered systems utilize living ecosystems,
        they also allow for and often rely on self-design of the system itself through
        the self-organizing quality of species populations and abiotic components.
        It is the utilization of natural ecosystems and self-design that differentiates
        ecological engineering from traditional engineering disciplines. Because engineering
        is inherently based on complete knowledge of and control over designs, there
        has been some resistance to the concept of self-design from traditional engineering
        disciplines. In fact, ecological engineering is applicable to only a subset
        of problems but, where appropriate, it offers solutions that can be more effective
        and sustainable than conventional approaches. The challenge is to combine
        the strengths of ecology and engineering to create a new paradigm for environmental
        problem solving. Ecological engineering is both an academic field with curricula
        taught in universities and with a regularly published journal of peer-reviewed
        articles (Ecological Engineering by Elsevier) along with a practical field
        where systems are designed, built, and operated by commercial companies for
        clients. Professional societies, such as the American Ecological Engineering
        Society, have arisen to try to better connect theory and practice in this
        emerging discipline through the use of certification programs and annual meetings
        of academics and practitioners.<\/p>","DOI":"10.1093\/obo\/9780199830060-0217","type":"reference-entry","created":{"date-parts":[[2019,6,26]],"date-time":"2019-06-26T07:24:40Z","timestamp":1561533880000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Ecological

        education is the process of creating an ecological understanding or literacy
        whose dimensions and parameters have changed through time both in regard to
        and in relation with the development of ecology as a science and the needs
        the user\/learner. As such, it should be seen as a fluid and dynamic system
        of learning and information chosen to suit the specific needs of the situation.
        In this context, ecological literacy is defined as giving the learner such
        information as to allow for sound, scientifically based decisions to be made
        about a given ecological situation or context. The scope of ecological education
        is vast\u2014it ranges from the most specific and detailed knowledge for researchers
        to limited and general ideas in primary school education. Likewise, the avenues
        through which it is disseminated are equally diverse\u2014from university
        to business to local citizen group. There are no widely agreed models of ecological
        education; however, a structural look at the topic suggests four elements
        (the first three of which are reported here). The first, agency, refers to
        the capacity of individuals to actively access, gain, and benefit from a study
        of ecology. Thus, age, interests, gender, education, prior experience, etc.
        all play a part in constructing and constraining the individual\u2019s access
        to ecological knowledge. Second, these individuals then need to access educational
        opportunities, i.e., context. Scales from local to global and formal to informal
        encompass the wide range of options with schools, higher education, business,
        pressure groups, media, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) carrying
        the bulk of instructional work. Third, there is the content, namely, the actual
        ecological concepts seen as required learning for any given situation. This
        would range from a very general overview, as might be seen in a secondary
        school course, to highly specific and detailed information needed by a researcher.
        In addition, content could range from the most theoretical models through
        to applied ecology. All three elements are underpinned by a philosophy whose
        own roots are far from clear cut. At one level, standard positivist perspectives
        give way to far more phenomenological and structural ideas, such as queer
        theory, eco-feminism, and deep green ecology, that privilege and dictate the
        range of knowledge \u201cpermitted.\u201d Finally, it is worth noting that
        Ecology as a term derives from the late 19th century. However, as an idea
        it can be traced back to Greek times if not before. Still, as a modern endeavor,
        it is best seen from the 1950s onward, as treated here.<\/p>","DOI":"10.1093\/obo\/9780199830060-0235","type":"reference-entry","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,25]],"date-time":"2021-05-25T07:40:30Z","timestamp":1621928430000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Ecological

        has informed and underpinned agricultural production since the first faltering
        steps in domestication and cultivation. When someone (probably a woman) living
        in the Fertile Crescent carried seeds of wild wheats and barleys from the
        great natural cereal stands of the region and sowed them near her house she
        initiated the process of domestication. She also began the process of crop
        cultivation, creating what were to become ecologically complex, home gardens.
        Similarly swidden agriculture was based on imitations of ecological processes
        that would create a sustainable form of agriculture. The first articulation
        of this concept was not for many thousands of years later. The great Roman
        writer and agriculturalist of the first century bc, Marcus Terentius Varro,
        wrote as follows (Hooper and Ash, 1935) : . . . Agri cultura est \u2018Non
        modo est ars, sed etiam necessaria ac magna; eaque est scientia, quae sint
        in quoque agro serenda ac facienda, quo terra maximos perpetuo reddat fructus\u2019
        . . . Agriculture is \u2018not only an art but an important and noble art.
        It is, as well, a science, which teaches us what crops are to be planted in
        each kind of soil, and what operations are to be carried on, in order that
        the land may regularly produce the largest crops.\u2019 (Varro, Rerum Rusticarum
        I, III) Not only does Varro place crops in their environment but the phrase
        quo terra maximos perpetuo reddat fructus (which can be translated as \u2018that
        the land yields the highest in perpetuity\u2019) struck me, when I first came
        upon it in one of the little red Loeb Classical Library translations, as an
        extraordinarily clear, elegant, and concise definition of sustainability.
        In this chapter I want to illustrate how ecological concepts illuminate the
        building blocks of agriculture\u2014gardens, swiddens, pastures, orchards,
        and fields\u2014and provide a basis for the continuing challenge of feeding
        everyone in an increasing population. The transformation of an ecosystem into
        an agroecosystem involves a number of significant changes. The system itself
        becomes more clearly defined, at least in terms of its biological and physico-chemical
        boundaries. These become sharper and less permeable, the linkages with other
        systems being limited and channeled. <\/p>","DOI":"10.1093\/oso\/9780199209989.003.0015","type":"book-chapter","created":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,11]],"date-time":"2020-11-11T01:44:58Z","timestamp":1605059098000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":2,"title":["A
